        <p>The film was announced in October 2014 as Avengers: Infinity War – Part 2, but Marvel later removed this title. The Russo brothers joined as directors in April 2015, with Markus and McFeely signing on to write the script a month later. The film serves as a conclusion to the story of the MCU up to that point, ending the story arcs for several main characters. Filming began in August 2017 at<i> Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayette County, Georgia,</i> shooting back-to-back with Infinity War, and ended in January 2018. Additional filming took place in the Metro and <i>Downtown Atlanta areas, New York, Scotland, and England.</i> The story revisits several moments from earlier films, bringing back actors and settings from throughout the franchise as well as music from previous films. The official title was revealed in<i> December 2018.</i> With an estimated budget of $356 million, it is one of the most expensive films ever made.</p>
